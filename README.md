# Using Administrative Data to Understand UK Civil Society Organisations

## Introduction

Welcome to the home of the UK Third Sector and Civil Society Data Resources! We are an ESRC funded group of collaborators seeking to improve data infrastructure surrounding the UK’s third sector and civil society more generally. The grant is entitled “Improving Access to and Use of Organisation-Level Data on the Third Sector and Civil Society” (Project Reference: ES/X000524/1).

This repository provides training materials for individuals wishing to learn how to use a range of data resources relating to civil society organisations in the UK. A range of materials are provided, including presentations, interactive notebooks for exploring the data, and further reading.

These materials are aimed at researchers, policy makers and civil society organisations interested in understanding the scale and shape of UK civil society.

## Materials

The training materials can be found in the following folders:
* [code](./code) - Jupyter Notebooks containing executable Python.
* [presentations](./presentations) - PDFs and recordings of the course lectures.
* [reading](./readings) - lists of interesting and relevant reading materials.
